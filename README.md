# vit-object-localisation
This is my project on vision transformers. Here, I have built the model from scratch and trained it on caltech-101 dataset for object localistion. Check out the project and hit me up if you have any doubts or suggestions. My friend Shivam's project on vit is used as the guide and reference for this project. Do check out his github repo : https://github.com/shibuchagotra
